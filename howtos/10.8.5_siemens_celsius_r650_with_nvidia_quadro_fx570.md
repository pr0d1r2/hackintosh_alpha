# 10.8.5 Siemens Celsius R650 with Nvidia Quadro FX570 on 4x15kSAS-disk-RAID0

## Get it work

* Get iAtkos ML2
* Burn DVD
* Run machine
* Press F12 for boot menu
* Boot DVD with options: -v (for tracking possible errors from extra hardware)
* open: Utilities -> Disk Utility
* On the left-hand column of Disk Utility, you should see the 4 hard disks that you will be using for your RAID 0 array.
  Click on first of them, and then click the "RAID" tab.
  Move disks one-by-one to array window.
  From here, name your RAID 0 array, and be sure to set your RAID type to "Striped RAID Set".
  You may also consider "Concatenated Disk Set" when having different size disks but it will decrease performance to single disk.
  Click "Create" and after finish you should get your disks RAIDed.
* Customize install:
  - select resolution from: Bootloader Options -> Graphics Mode
  - enable: Drivers -> VGA -> NVIDIA -> Old Cards
* Install
* Boot
* Customize your machine
* Make first user
* Log in
* Run `sudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHPET.kext` to get high speed USB (usually you want to install combo from USB drive)
* Reboot
* Run combo update to 10.8.5
* Reboot
* Run `sudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHPET.kext` to get high speed USB (after combo)
* Reboot
* Install "Blackmagic Disk Speed Test" from AppStore and check disk performance (should be 440/440)

## Not working

* I was not able to run onboard ALC888 audio running (this is not problem as i use Bluetooth audio)

## Data encryption

As on this machine FileVault2 does not work we need to use per user legacy FileVault:

* Log in to account you wish to have encrypted
* Setup legacy FileVault following instructions from: https://github.com/pr0d1r2/hackintosh_alpha (note that disk performance in your homedir will drop to 80/80 but apps will still load blazing fast)
* Log out
* Log in
